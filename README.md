# Job Tagger Application ü§ñ

This Streamlit application is designed to assist in tagging job postings. Users are presented with a random job posting from the MCF dataset, and they're asked to tag the posting with the most suitable job category from the SSOC (Singapore Standard Occupational Classification) list.

## Features

1. **Random Job Selection**: Each session will randomly select a job posting from the MCF dataset.
2. **SSOC Predictions**: Based on a pre-trained model, the application suggests the top-n SSOC categories that might match the job posting.
3. **User Interaction**: Users can choose the most suitable SSOC category or skip if none of the predictions match.
4. **Integration with Google Sheets**: Selected SSOC categories, along with the job posting, are saved in a Google Sheet for future reference.

## Setup

1. Ensure you have the required libraries installed:
    - streamlit
    - pandas
    - numpy
    - pickle
    - datetime

2. The following datasets and models should be present in the respective directories:
    - Pre-trained model: `model/autocoder.pkl`
    - SSOC list: `data/ssoc.csv`

3. If you wish to connect with Google Sheets API, make sure you've set up the API and the `setup_gspread` function in the `utils` file is configured correctly.
